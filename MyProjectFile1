Project Name: MTSorter

Problem Statement: To find the fastest and slowest sorting algorithms

Requirements: Use eight sorting algorithms to sort some arrays

Outcome: It should output the times that it took for each sorting algorithms to sort and the average of each experiment.

Characteristics of the Software:

- Has eight sorting algorithms
- Uses threads
- computes average of the sorting experiment
- shows time of each sorting experiment
